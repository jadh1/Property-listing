## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [x] Node.js 20+ installed
- [x] pnpm (recommended) or npm
- [x] Clerk account with Billing enabled
- [x] Sanity project created
- [x] Mapbox access token

### Step-by-Step Setup

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jadh1/Property-listing.git
cd Property-listing
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
pnpm install
```

**3. Set up environment variables**

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Clerk - Authentication & Billing
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

# Sanity - CMS
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-write-token

# Mapbox - Maps & Geocoding
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=pk.xxxxx
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.xxxxx

# App URL (for metadata)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

> 🔒 **Security Note:** Never commit `.env.local` to version control. The `.gitignore` already excludes it.

> 💡 **Tip:** Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are exposed to the browser. Keep sensitive tokens (like `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` and `SANITY_API_TOKEN`) without this prefix.

**4. Set up Sanity**

```bash
# Generate TypeScript types from your schema
pnpm typegen
```

**5. Set up Clerk Billing**

In your Clerk Dashboard:
1. Enable Billing in your application
2. Create a "Free" plan (no price)
3. Create an "Agent" plan at $29/month
4. The app uses `has({ plan: "agent" })` to check subscriptions

**6. Seed the database (optional)**

```bash
# Seed sample data
pnpm seed

# Clean and reseed
pnpm seed:clean
```

**7. Run the development server**

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

**8. Access Sanity Studio (Admin Dashboard)**

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/studio](http://localhost:3000/studio) to manage content:
- Create/edit properties
- Manage agents and users
- View leads
- Full CMS control with real-time preview

### ✅ First Time Setup Checklist

- [ ] Created Clerk application with Billing enabled
- [ ] Created Sanity project and obtained tokens
- [ ] Got Mapbox access token
- [ ] Set up all environment variables
- [ ] Generated TypeScript types with `pnpm typegen`
- [ ] (Optional) Seeded database with sample data

## 🗄️ Database Schema Overview

### Collections

| Collection | Purpose | Key Fields |
|------------|---------|------------|
| `property` | Property listings | title, price, status, location, agent ref, amenities |
| `agent` | Agent profiles (linked to Clerk) | userId, name, licenseNumber |
| `user` | Homebuyer profiles | clerkId, savedListings |
| `lead` | Buyer inquiries | property ref, agent ref, status |
| `amenity` | Property amenities | name, icon, category |

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Lazy Agent Creation**: Agent documents are created on first dashboard access (after subscribing), not via webhooks. Clerk Billing is the source of truth.

2. **Geopoint for Location**: Properties use Sanity's `geopoint` type for accurate map placement.

3. **Reference Relationships**: Properties reference their agent, leads reference both property and agent for efficient querying.

4. **Seed ID Prefixes**: Seeded data uses `seed_` prefixed IDs for easy cleanup during development.

## 🚢 Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

**Option 1: Vercel CLI**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
pnpm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

**Option 2: GitHub Integration**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the repository in Vercel Dashboard
3. Add environment variables
4. Deploy!

### Post-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set in Vercel
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Test subscription/billing flow
- [ ] Verify Sanity content is loading
- [ ] Check maps are rendering correctly
- [ ] Set up CORS origins in Sanity (if needed)

### Monitoring (Recommended)

- **Vercel Analytics** - Page performance
- **Clerk Dashboard** - Auth metrics
- **Sanity Manage** - Content analytics
